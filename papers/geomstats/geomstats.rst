Introduction to Geometric Statistics in Python with Geomstats
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

There is a growing interest in leveraging differential geometry in the machine learning community. Yet, the adoption of the associated geometric computations has been inhibited by the lack of reference implementation. Such implementation should typically allow its users: (i) to get intuition on concepts from differential geometry through a hands-on approach, often not provided by traditional textbooks; and (ii) to run geometric statistical learning algorithms seemlessly, without delving into the mathematical details. To adress this gap, we introduce the open-source Python package :code:`geomstats` and present hands-on tutorials of differential geometry in statistics - Geometric Statistics - that rely on it. Code and documentation: :code:`www.geomstats.ai`.


.. class:: keywords

   different geometry, statistics, manifold, machine learning

Introduction
------------

Data on manifolds naturally arise in different fields. Hyperspheres model directional data in molecular and protein biology :cite:`Kent2005UsingStructure`, and some aspects of 3D shapes :cite:`Jung2012AnalysisSpheres, Hong2016`. Density estimation on hyperbolic spaces arises to model electrical impedances :cite:`Huckemann2010MobiusEstimation`, networks :cite:`Asta2014GeometricComparison` or reflection coefficients extracted from a radar signal :cite:`Chevallier2015ProbabilityProcessing`. Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices are used to characterize data from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) :cite:`Pennec2006b, Yuan2012` and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) :cite:`Sporns2005TheBrain`. Examples of manifold data are numerous: as a result, there is a growing interest in leveraging differential geometry in the machine learning community.

Yet, the adoption of differential geometry computations has been inhibited by the lack of a reference implementation. Code sequences are often custom-tailored for specific problems and are not easily reused. Some python packages do exist, but focus on optimization (Pymanopt :cite:`Townsend2016Pymanopt:Differentiation`, Geoopt :cite:`Becigneul2018RiemannianMethods, Kochurov2019Geoopt:Optim`, and McTorch :cite:`Meghwanshi2018McTorchLearning`), are dedicated to a single manifold (PyRiemann :cite:`Barachant2015PyRiemann:Interface`, PyQuaternion :cite:`Wynn2014PyQuaternions:Quaternions`, PyGeometry :cite:`Censi2012PyGeometry:Manifolds.`), or lack unit-tests and continuous integration (TheanoGeometry :cite:`Kuhnel2017ComputationalTheano`). There is a need for an open-source low-level implementation of differential geometry, and associated learning algorithms, for manifold-valued data.

We present :code:`geomstats`, an open-source Python package of computations and statistics for data on non-linear manifolds: a field called Geometric Statistics. We provide object-oriented and extensively unit-tested implementations, supported for different execution backends -- namely NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. This paper illustrates the use of :code:`geomstats` through hands-on introductory tutorials of geometric statistics. The tutorials enable users: (i) to get intuition on concepts from differential geometry through a hands-on approach, often not provided by traditional textbooks; and (ii) to run geometric statistical learning algorithms seemlessly, without delving into the mathematical details.


Presentation of Geomstats
-------------------------

The package :code:`geomstats` is organized into two main modules: :code:`geometry` and :code:`learning`. The module `geometry` implements low-level differential geometry with an object-oriented approach and two main parent classes: :code:`Manifold` and :code:`RiemannianMetric`. Standard manifolds like the hypersphere or the hyperbolic space are classes that inherit from :code:`Manifold`. The class :code:`RiemannianMetric` provides computations related to Riemannian geometry, such as the inner product of two tangent vectors at a base point, the geodesic distance between two points, the Exponential and Logarithm maps at a base point, etc.

The module `learning` implements statistics and machine learning algorithms for data on manifolds. The code is object-oriented and classes inherit from :code:`scikit-learn` base classes and mixin: :code:`BaseEstimator`, :code:`ClassifierMixin`, :code:`RegressorMixin`, etc. This module provides implementations of Frechet mean estimators, K-means and principal component analysis (PCA) designed for manifold data. The algorithms can be applied seamlessly to the different manifolds implemented in the library.

The code follows international standards for readability and ease of collaboration, is vectorized for batch computations, undergoes unit-testing with continuous integration, relies on TensorFlow/PyTorch backend allowing GPU acceleration. The package comes with a :code:`visualization` module that enables users to develop an intuition on differential geometry.


Tutorial: Computing with data on manifolds
------------------------------------------

This section shows how to use :code:`geomstats` to learn the essential concepts of differential geometry and Riemannian geometry. This hands-on approach complements traditional textbooks, that often focus on the theoretical explanations.

Set up
******

Before starting this tutorial, we import the backend that will be used for geomstats computation, as well as the visualization module. In the command line::

    export GEOMSTATS_BACKEND=numpy

then, in the python script:

.. code:: ipython3

    import geomstats.backend as gs
    import geomstats.visualization as visualization

    visualization.tutorial_matplotlib()

.. parsed-literal::

    INFO: Using numpy backend

Modules related to :code:`matplotlib` should be imported during setup too.

From data on linear spaces to data on manifolds
***********************************************

We first illustrate how Geometric Statistics differ from traditional Statistics. Statistical theory is usually defined
for data belonging to vector spaces, which are *linear spaces*. For
example, we know how to compute the mean of a data set of numbers, like
the mean of students’ weights in a classroom, or of multidimensional
arrays, like the average 3D velocity vector of blood cells in a vessel.

Now consider a non-linear space: a manifold. A manifold
:math:`M` of dimension :math:`m` is a space that is allowed to be
curved but that looks like an :math:`m`-dimensional vector space in the
neighborhood of every point. A sphere, like the earth, is a good example of a manifold.
What happens to the usual statistical theory when the data does not
naturally belong to a linear space. For example, if we want to perform
statistics on the coordinates of world cities, which lie on the earth: a
sphere?


.. code:: ipython3

    from geomstats.geometry.hypersphere import Hypersphere

    sphere = Hypersphere(dim=2)
    points_in_manifold = sphere.random_uniform(
         n_samples=2)

    linear_mean = gs.sum(
        points_in_manifold, axis=0) / n_samples

..  fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    visualization.plot(
        points_in_manifold,
        ax=ax, space='S2', label='Point', s=80)
    ax.plot(
        points_in_manifold[:, 0],
        points_in_manifold[:, 1],
        points_in_manifold[:, 2],
        linestyle='dashed', alpha=0.5)
    ax.scatter(
        linear_mean[0],
        linear_mean[1],
        linear_mean[2],
        label='Mean', s=80, alpha=0.5)
    ax.set_title('Mean of points on a manifold')
    ax.legend();


.. image:: 01_data_on_manifolds_files/01_data_on_manifolds_18_0.png

|

What happened? The mean of two points on a manifold (the sphere) is not
on the manifold. In our example, the mean city is not on the earth. This
leads to errors in statistical computations. The line:

.. code:: ipython3

    sphere.belongs(linear_mean)

returns :code:`False`. For this reason, researchers aim to build a theory of statistics that is
by construction compatible with any structure we equip the manifold
with. This theory is called *Geometric Statistics*.


From vector spaces to manifolds
*******************************

**Geometric Statistics** is a theory of statistics on manifolds, that
takes into account their geometric structures. Geometric Statistics is
therefore the child of two major pillars of Mathematics: Geometry and
Statistics.

This subsection shows how to load geometric datasets using the module :code:`datasets`,
and perform elementary operations of Riemannian geometry.

We import the dataset :code:`cities` of the coordinates of cities on the earth.

.. code:: ipython3

    import geomstats.datasets.utils as data_utils

    data, names = data_utils.load_cities()

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

    visualization.plot(
        data[15:20], ax=ax, space='S2',
        label=names[15:20], s=80, alpha=0.5)

.. image:: 01_data_on_manifolds_files/01_data_on_manifolds_32_0.png

|

The elementary operations on a vector space are: addition, substraction
and multiplication by a scalar. We can add a vector to a point,
substract two points to get a vector, or multiply a vector by a scalar
value.

For points on a manifold, like the sphere, the same operations are not
permitted. Indeed, adding a vector to a point will not give a point that
belongs to the manifold. The exponential map is the operation that generalizes the addition of a
vector to a point, on manifolds.

The exponential map takes a point and a tangent vector as inputs, and
outputs the point on the manifold that is reached by “shooting” with the
tangent vector. “Shooting” means taking the path of shortest length.
This path is called a “geodesic”.


.. code:: ipython3

    from geomstats.geometry.hypersphere import \
        Hypersphere

    sphere = Hypersphere(dim=2)

    paris = data[19]
    vector = gs.array([1, 0, 0.8])
    tangent_vector = sphere.to_tangent(
         vector, base_point=paris)

    result = sphere.metric.exp(
        tangent_vector, base_point=paris)

    geodesic = sphere.metric.geodesic(
        initial_point=paris,
        initial_tangent_vec=tangent_vector)

    points_on_geodesic = geodesic(
        gs.linspace(0., 1., 30))


.. image:: 02_from_vector_spaces_to_manifolds_files/02_from_vector_spaces_to_manifolds_19_0.png

|

The logarithm map is the operation that generalizes the substraction of
two points, that gives a vector.

The logarithm map takes two points on the manifold as inputs, and
outputs the tangent vector that is required to “shoot” from one point to
the other.

.. code:: ipython3

    paris = data[19]
    beijing = data[15]

    log = sphere.metric.log(
        point=beijing,
        base_point=paris)


So far, we have given examples of geodesics on the sphere. The sphere is
a simple manifold that is easy to visualize. Yet, :code:`geomstats` provides
many more manifolds, on which the exp and log are defined.

We consider the special euclidean group in 3D, which is the group of 3D
rotations and 3D translations. One element of this group can be
represented by a frame, oriented by the 3D rotation, and located by the
3D translation from the origin.

We create two points in SE(3), and compute the geodesic between them. We visualize the
geodesic in the group SE(3), which is a path of frames in 3D.

.. code:: ipython3

    from geomstats.geometry.special_euclidean import \
        SpecialEuclidean

    se3 = SpecialEuclidean(n=3, point_type='vector')
    metric = se3.left_canonical_metric

    initial_point = se3.identity
    initial_tangent_vec = gs.array(
        [1.8, 0.2, 0.3, 3., 3., 1.])
    geodesic = metric.geodesic(
        initial_point=initial_point,
        initial_tangent_vec=initial_tangent_vec)

    points = geodesic(gs.linspace(-3., 3., 40))

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

    visualization.plot(
        points, ax=ax, space='SE3_GROUP');

Tutorial: Classification of SPD matrices
----------------------------------------

Manifold of SPD matrices
************************

We consider a manifold embedded in the general linear group of invertible matrices. The manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices in :math:`n` dimensions is defined as:

.. math::
    SPD = \left\{
    S \in \mathbb{R}_{n \times n}: S^T = S, \forall herez \in \mathbb{R}^n, z \neq 0, z^TSz > 0
    \right\}.

There class \texttt{SPDMatricesSpace} inherits from the class \texttt{EmbeddedManifold} and has an \texttt{embedding\_manifold} attribute which stores an object of the class \texttt{GeneralLinearGroup}. We equip the manifold of SPD matrices with an object of the class \texttt{SPDMetric} that implements the affine-invariant Riemannian metric of \cite{Pennec2006b} and inherits from the class \texttt{RiemannianMetric}.

Visualization of SPD matrices
*****************************

SPD matrices in the literature
******************************

SPD matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning across many fields \cite{Cherian2016}, either as input or output to the problem. In diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for instance, voxels are represented by "diffusion tensors" which are 3x3 SPD matrices. These ellipsoids spatially characterize the diffusion of water molecules in the tissues. Each DTI thus consists in a field of SPD matrices, which are inputs to regression models. In \cite{Yuan2012} for example, the authors use an intrinsic local polynomial regression applied to comparison of fiber tracts between HIV subjects and a control group. Similarly, in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it is possible to extract connectivity graphs from a set of patients' resting-state images' time series \cite{sporns2005human,wang2013disrupted,ingalhalikar2014sex}-- a framework known as brain connectomics. The regularized graph Laplacians of the graphs form a dataset of SPD matrices. They represent a compact summary of the brain's connectivity patterns which is used to assess neurological responses to a variety of stimuli (drug, pathology, patient's activity, etc.).

More generally speaking, covariance matrices are also SPD matrices which appear in many settings. We find covariance clustering used for sound compression in acoustic models of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems \cite{Shinohara2010} or for material classification \cite{Faraki2015} among others. Covariance descriptors are also popular image or video descriptors \cite{Harandi2014}.

Lastly, SPD matrices have found applications in deeep learning, where they are used as features extracted by a neural network. The authors of \cite{Gao2017} show that an aggregation of learned deep convolutional features into a SPD matrix creates a robust representation of images that enables to outperform state-of-the-art methods on visual classification.

Classification of SPD matrices with Geomstats
*********************************************

We show through a concrete brain connectome application to show \texttt{geomstats} can be easily leveraged for efficient supervised learning on the space of SPD matrices. The folder \texttt{brain\_connectome} of the supplementary materials contains the implementation of this use case.

We consider the fMRI data from the 2014 MLSP Schizophrenia Classification challenge\footnote{Data openly available at \url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlsp-2014-mri}}, consisting of the resting-state fMRIs of 86 patients split into two balanced categories: control vs people suffering schizophrenia. Consistently with the connectome literature, we tackle the classification task by using a SVM classifier on the precomputed pairwise-similarities between subjects. The critical step lies in our ability to correctly identify similar brain structures, here represented by regularized Laplacian SPD matrices $\hat{L}=(D-A)+\gamma I$, where A and D are respectively the adjacency and the degree matrices of a given connectome. The parameter $\gamma$ is a regularization shown to have little effect on the classification performance \cite{Dodero2015}.

Following two popular approaches in there literature \cite{Dodero2015}, we define similarities between connectomes through kernels relying on the Riemannian distance :math:`d_R(\hat{L}_1,\hat{L}_2)= ||\log(\hat{L}_1^{-1/2}.\hat{L}_2.\hat{L}_1^{-1/2})||_F` and on the log-Euclidean distance, a computationally-lighter proxy for the first:
:math:`d_{LED}(\hat{L}_1,\hat{L}_2)= ||\log_{I}(\hat{L}_2) -\log_{I}(\hat{L}_1)||_F`. In these formulae, :math:`\log` is the matrix logarithm and :math:`F` refers to the Frobenius norm. Both of these similarities are easily computed with \texttt{geomstats}, for example the Riemannian distance is obtained through \texttt{metric.squared\_dist} where \texttt{metric} is an instance of the class \texttt{SPDMetric}.


Figure~\ref{convertedfig:SPD} (left) shows the performance of these similarities for graph classification, which we benchmark against a standard Frobenius distance. With an out-of-sample accuracy of 61.2\%, the log-Euclidean distance here achieves the best performance. Interestingly, the affine-invariant Riemannian distance on SPD matrices is the distance that picks up the most differences between connectomes. While both the Frobenius and the log-Euclidean recover only very slight differences between connectomes --placing them almost uniformly afar from each other--, the Riemannian distance exhibits greater variability, as shown by the clustermap in Figure~\ref{fig:SPD} (right). Given the ease of implementation of these similarities with \texttt{geomstats}, comparing them further opens research directions for in-depth connectome analysis.

Tutorial: Learning graph representations with Hyperbolic spaces
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperbolic spaces and machine learning applications
***************************************************

Before going into this tutorial, let us recall a few applications of hyperbolic spaces
in the machine learning literature. Hyperbolic spaces arise in information and
learning theory. Indeed, the space of univariate Gaussians endowed with the Fisher
metric densities is a hyperbolic space :cite:`1531851`. This characterization
is used in various fields, such as in image processing, where each image pixel is
represented by a Gaussian distribution :cite:`Angulo2014`, or in radar signal
processing where the corresponding echo is represented by a stationary Gaussian process :cite:`Arnaudon2013`.

The hyperbolic spaces can also be stanfordeen as continuous versions of trees and are
therefore interesting when learning hierarchical representations of data
:cite:`Nickel2017`. Hyperbolic geometric graphs (HGG) have also been suggested
as a promising model for social networks, where the hyperbolicity appears through
a competition between similarity and popularity of an individual :cite:`papadopoulos2012popularity`.

Tutorial context and description
********************************

Recently, the embedding of Graph Structured Data (GSD) on manifolds has
received considerable attention. Learning GSD has known major achievements in recent years thanks to the
discovery of hyperbolic embeddings. Although it has been speculated since
several years that hyperbolic spaces would better represent GSD than
Euclidean spaces :cite:`Gromov1987` :cite:`PhysRevE` :cite:`hhh` :cite:`6729484`, it is only recently
that these speculations have been proven effective through concrete studies
and applications :cite:`Nickel2017` :cite:`DBLP:journals/corr/ChamberlainCD17` :cite:`DBLP:conf/icml/SalaSGR18` :cite:`gerald2019node`.
As outlined by :cite:`Nickel2017`, Euclidean embeddings require large
dimensions to capture certain complex relations such as the Wordnet
noun hierarchy. On the other hand, this complexity can be captured by
a simple model of hyperbolic geometry such as the Poincaré disc of two
dimensions :cite:`DBLP:conf/icml/SalaSGR18`.
Additionally, hyperbolic embeddings provide better visualisation of
clusters on graphs than Euclidean embeddings
:cite:`DBLP:journals/corr/ChamberlainCD17`.

In the scope of these recent
discoveries, this tutorial shows how to learn such embeddings in ``geomstats``
using the Poincaré Ball manifold applied to the well-known ‘Karate Club’ dataset.
We will first recall a few properties of hyperbolic spaces. Then show how to
import the necessary modules from `geomstats` and initialize embedding parameters.
The embedding method is then presented formally while showing how it is
implemented in `geomstats`. Finally the resulting embedding is plotted.

Hyperbolic space
****************

The :math:`n`-dimensional hyperbolic space :math:`H_n` is defined by its
embedding in the :math:`(n+1)`-dimensional Minkowski space, which is a flat
pseudo-Riemannian manifold, as:

.. math::
   :label: hyperbolic

   H_{n} = \left\{
        x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}: - x_1^2 + ... + x_1{n+1}^2 = -1
    \right\}.

We can visualize the hyperbolic space :math:`H_2` through the Poincare disk representation,
where the border of the disk is at infinity. Geodesics are
the shortest path between two points.
The user can then observe how a geodesic grid and a geodesic square are deformed in the
hyperbolic geometry on Figures :ref:`fig:grid` and :ref:`fig:square`. Additionally, Figure :ref:`fig:geopoincare` shows how
geodesics between pairs of points behave when the pairs gradually
move away from the center of the disk and from each other.
Denote as :math:`d` the distance between two points, it corresponds to the length
of the geodesic that links them.

Learning graph representations with hyperbolic spaces in `Geomstats`
********************************************************************

Setup
~~~~~

We start by importing standard tools for logging and visualization,
allowing us to draw the embedding of the GSD on the manifold. Next, we
import the manifold of interest, visualization tools, and other methods
from ``geomstats``.

.. code:: ipython3

    import logging

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    import geomstats
    import geomstats.backend as gs
    import geomstats.visualization as visualization
    from geomstats.datasets
        import graph_data_preparation as gdp
    from geomstats.geometry.poincare_ball
        import PoincareBall


Parameters and Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Table :ref:`tabparam` defines the parameters needed for embedding.
Let us discuss a few things about the parameters of the above table. The
number of dimensions should be high (i.e., 10+) for large datasets
(i.e., where the number of nodes/edges is significantly large). In this
tutorial we consider a dataset that is quite small with only 34 nodes.
The Poincaré disk of only two dimensions is therefore sufficient to
capture the complexity of the graph and provide a faithful
representation. Some parameters are hard to know in advance, such as
``max_epochs`` and ``lr``. These should be tuned specifically for each
dataset. Visualization can help with tuning the parameters. Also, one
can perform a grid search to find values of these parameters which
maximize some performance function. In learning embeddings, one can
consider performance metrics such as a measure for cluster seperability
or normalized mutual information (NMI) or others. Similarly, the number
of negative samples and context size can also be thought of as
hyperparameters and will be further discussed in the sequel. An instance
of the ``Graph`` class is created and set to the Karate club dataset.
The latter and several others can be found in the ``datasets.data`` module.

The Zachary karate club network was collected from the members of a
university karate club by Wayne Zachary in 1977. Each node represents a
member of the club, and each edge represents an undirected relation
between two members. An often discussed problem using this dataset is to
find the two groups of people into which the karate club split after an
argument between two teachers. Figure :ref:`karafig` displays the dataset graph.
Further information about the dataset is
displayed to provide insight into its complexity.

Let us now prepare the hyperbolic space for embedding.
Recall that :math:`H_2` is the Poincaré disk equipped with the distance function
:math:`d`. Declaring an instance of the ``PoincareBall`` manifold of two dimensions

Learning embedding by optimizing a loss function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Denote :math:`V` as the set of nodes and :math:`E \subset V\times V` the
set of edges. The goal of embedding GSD is to provide a faithful and
exploitable representation of the graph structure. It is mainly achieved
by preserving *first-order* proximity that enforces nodes sharing edges
to be close to each other. It can additionally preserve *second-order*
proximity that enforces two nodes sharing the same context (i.e., nodes
that are neighbours but not necessarily directly connected) to be close.
To preserve first and second-order proximities we adopt a loss function
similar to :cite:`NIPS2017_7213` and consider the negative sampling
approach as in :cite:`NIPS2013_5021` :

.. math::      \mathcal{L} = - \sum_{v_i\in V} \sum_{v_j \in C_i} \bigg[ log(\sigma(-d^2(\phi_i, \phi_j'))) + \sum_{v_k\sim \mathcal{P}_n} log(\sigma(d^2(\phi_i, \phi_k')))  \bigg]

where :math:`\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}` is the sigmoid function and
:math:`\phi_i \in \mathbb{B}^m` is the embedding of the :math:`i`-th
node of :math:`V`, :math:`C_i` the nodes in the context of the
:math:`i`-th node, :math:`\phi_j'\in \mathbb{B}^m` the embedding of
:math:`v_j\in C_i` and :math:`\mathcal{P}_n` the negative sampling
distribution over :math:`V`:
:math:`\mathcal{P}_n(v)=\frac{deg(v)^{3/4}}{\sum_{v_i\in V}deg(v_i)^{3/4}}`.
Intuitively one can see that to minimizing :math:`L`, the distance
between :math:`v_i` and :math:`v_j` should get smaller, while the one
between :math:`v_i` and :math:`v_k` would get larger.

Riemannian optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the idea of we use the following formula to optimize
:math:`L`:

.. math::  \phi^{t+1} = \text{Exp}_{\phi^t} \left( -lr \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \right)

where :math:`\phi` is a parameter of :math:`L`,
:math:`t\in\{1,2,\cdots\}` is the epoch iteration number and :math:`lr`
is the learning rate. The formula consists of first computing the usual
gradient of the loss function giving the direction in which the
parameter should move. The Riemannian exponential map :math:`\text{Exp}`
is a function that takes a base point :math:`\phi^t` and some direction
vector :math:`T` and returns the point :math:`\phi^{t+1}` such that
:math:`\phi^{t+1}` belongs to the geodesic initiated from
:math:`\phi{t}` in the direction of :math:`T` and the length of the
geoedesic curve between :math:`\phi^t` and :math:`\phi^{t+1}` is of 1
unit. The Riemannian exponential map is implemented as a method of the
``PoincareBallMetric`` class in the ``geometry`` module of
``geomstats``.

Therefore to minimize :math:`L` we will need to compute its gradient.
Several steps are required to do so, 1. Compute the gradient of the
squared distance 2. Compute the gradient of the log sigmoid 3. Compute
the gradient of the composision of 1. and 2.

For 1., we use the formula proposed by which uses the Riemannian
logarithmic map to compute the gradient of the distance. This is
implemented as

.. code:: ipython3

    def grad_squared_distance(point_a, point_b):
        """Gradient of squared hyperbolic distance.

        Gradient of the squared distance based on the
        Ball representation according to point_a

        Parameters
        ----------
        point_a : array-like, shape=[n_samples, dim]
            First point in hyperbolic space.
        point_b : array-like, shape=[n_samples, dim]
            Second point in hyperbolic space.

        Returns
        -------
        dist : array-like, shape=[n_samples, 1]
            Geodesic squared distance between the two points.
        """
        hyperbolic_metric = PoincareBall(2).metric
        log_map = hyperbolic_metric.log(point_b, point_a)

        return -2 * log_map

For 2. define the ``log_sigmoid`` corresponding as follows:

.. code:: ipython3

    def log_sigmoid(vector):
        """Logsigmoid function.

        Apply log sigmoid function

        Parameters
        ----------
        vector : array-like, shape=[n_samples, dim]

        Returns
        -------
        result : array-like, shape=[n_samples, dim]
        """
        return gs.log((1 / (1 + gs.exp(-vector))))

The gradient of the logarithm of sigmoid function is implemented as:

.. code:: ipython3

    def grad_log_sigmoid(vector):
        """Gradient of log sigmoid function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        vector : array-like, shape=[n_samples, dim]

        Returns
        -------
        gradient : array-like, shape=[n_samples, dim]
        """
        return 1 / (1 + gs.exp(vector))

For 3., apply the composition rule to obtain the gradient of :math:`L`.
The following function given :math:`\phi_i`, :math:`\phi'_j` and
:math:`\phi'_k` returns the total value of :math:`L` and its gradient
vector at :math:`\phi_i`. For the value of :math:`L` the loss function
formula is simply applied. For the gradient, we apply the composition of
``grad_log_sigmoid`` with ``grad_squared_distance`` while paying
attention to the signs.

.. code:: ipython3

    def loss(example_embedding, context_embedding, negative_embedding,
             manifold):
        """Compute loss and grad.

        Compute loss and grad given embedding of the current example,
        embedding of the context and negative sampling embedding.

            negative_embedding.shape[0], example_embedding.shape[-1]
        example_embedding = gs.expand_dims(example_embedding, 0)
        context_embedding = gs.expand_dims(context_embedding, 0)
        positive_distance =\
            manifold.metric.squared_dist(
                example_embedding, context_embedding)

        example_grad = -(positive_grad + negative_grad.sum(axis=0))

        return total_loss, example_grad

Capturing the graph structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point we have the necessary bricks to compute the resulting
gradient of :math:`L`. We are ready to prepare the nodes :math:`v_i`,
:math:`v_j` and :math:`v_k` and initialise their embeddings
:math:`\phi_i`, :math:`\phi^{'}_j` and :math:`\phi^{'}_k`. First,
initialize an array that will hold embeddings :math:`\phi_i` of each
node :math:`v_i\in V` with random points belonging to the Poincaré disk.

.. code:: ipython3

    embeddings = gs.random.normal(size=(karate_graph.n_nodes, dim))
    embeddings = embeddings * 0.2

Next, to prepare the context nodes :math:`v_j` for each node
:math:`v_i`, we compute random walks initialised from each :math:`v_i`
up to some length (5 by default). The latter is done via a special
function within the ``Graph`` class. The nodes :math:`v_j` will be later
picked from the random walk of :math:`v_i`.

.. code:: ipython3

    random_walks = karate_graph.random_walk()

Negatively sampled nodes :math:`v_k` are chosen according to the
previously defined probability distribution function
:math:`\mathcal{P}_n(v_k)` implemented as

.. code:: ipython3

    negative_table_parameter = 5
    negative_sampling_table = []

    for i, nb_v in enumerate(nb_vertices_by_edges):
        negative_sampling_table +=\
            ([i] * int((nb_v**(3. / 4.))) * negative_table_parameter)

    negative_sampling_table = gs.array(negative_sampling_table)

Numerically optimizing the loss function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimising the loss function is performed numerically over the number of
epochs. At each iteration, we will compute the gradient of :math:`L`.
Then the graph nodes are moved in the direction pointed by the gradient.
The movement of the nodes is performed by following geodesics in the
gradient direction. The key to obtain an embedding representing
accurately the dataset, is to move the nodes smoothly rather than brutal
movements. This is done by tuning the learning rate, such as at each
epoch all the nodes made small movements.

A *first level* loop iterates over the epochs, the table ``total_loss``
will record the value of :math:`L` at each iteration and help us track
the minimization of :math:`L`.

A *second level* nested loop iterates over each path in the previously
computed random walks. Observing these walks, notice that nodes having
many edges appear more often. Such nodes can be considered as important
crossroads and will therefore be subject to a greater number of
embedding updates. This is one of the main reasons why random walks have
proven to be effective in capturing the structure of graphs. The context
of each :math:`v_i` will be the set of nodes :math:`v_j` belonging to
the random walk from :math:`v_i`. The ``context_size`` specified earlier
will limit the length of the walk to be considered. Similarly, we use
the same ``context_size`` to limit the number of negative samples. We
find :math:`\phi_i` from the ``embeddings`` array.

A *third level* nested loop will iterate on each :math:`v_j` and
:math:`v_k`. From within, we find :math:`\phi'_j` and :math:`\phi'_k`
then call the ``loss`` function to compute the gradient. Then the
Riemannian exponential map is applied to find the new value of
:math:`\phi_i` as we mentioned before.
